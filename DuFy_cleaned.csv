Eyes Close ,,,,"
The recent collaboration between Jisoo of BLACKPINK and Zayn Malik is the single ""Eyes Closed,"" released on October 10, 2025.

Here is the description and the lyrics in the style you requested:

""Eyes Closed"" by Jisoo & Zayn
This Soulful Pop/R&B Duet is characterized by a Tender and Dreamy atmosphere, conveying feelings of Affection, Hesitation, and a deep, Serious desire for a new beginning in love. The song is carried by a production that features Warm Keys, Acoustic Guitar, a Bass Synth, and Atmospheric Elements, all designed to highlight the distinct and emotional vocal blend of Jisoo's clear, emotive tone and Zayn's signature R&B-infused depth.

The central theme is the decision to dive into a new romance, acknowledging past mistakes and wounds (""history is proof""), but choosing to trust the connection and fall in love without reservation—effectively, with their eyes closed to the past. The track's cosmic music video visualizes this journey, showing the two singers floating through space before finding each other mid-orbit. It is ideal for Romantic content, Cinematic moments of connection, and Introspective or Lyrical video montages.

Lyrics
(Verse 1: Jisoo & Zayn)
Jisoo:
Time is standing still and I don't wanna leave your lips
Tracing my body with your fingertips

Zayn:
I know what you're feeling and I know you wanna say it (Yeah, say it)
I do too, but we gotta be patient (Gotta be patient)

(Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Zayn)
'Cause someone like me and someone like you
Really shouldn't work, yeah, the history is proof
Damned if I don't, damned if I do
You know, by now, we've seen it all

(Chorus: Jisoo & Zayn)
Said, oh, we should fall in love with our eyes closed
Better if we keep it where we don't know
The beds we've been in, the names and the faces of who we were with
And, oh, ain't nobody perfect, but it's all good
The past can't hurt us if we don't look
Let's let it go, better if we fall in love with our eyes closed

(Post-Chorus: Jisoo)
Oh, oh, oh

(Verse 2: Jisoo & Zayn)
Jisoo:
I got tunnel vision every second that you're with me
No, I don't care what anybody says, just kiss me (Oh)

Zayn:
'Cause you look like trouble, but it could be good
I've been the same, kind of misunderstood
Whatever you've done, trust, it ain't nothing new
You know by now we've seen it all

(Chorus: Jisoo & Zayn)
Said, oh, we should fall in love with our eyes closed
Better if we keep it where we don't know
The beds we've been in, the names and the faces of who we were with
And, oh, ain't nobody perfect, but it's all good
The past can't hurt us if we don't look
Let's let it go, better if we fall in love with our eyes closed

(Post-Chorus: Jisoo)
Oh, oh, oh
Keep your eyes closed

(Bridge: Jisoo & Zayn)
I'll take the risk for you
I know I'm feeling it too

(Chorus: Jisoo & Zayn)
Said, oh, we should fall in love with our eyes closed
Better if we keep it where we don't know
The beds we've been in, the names and the faces of who we were with
And, oh, ain't nobody perfect, but it's all good
The past can't hurt us if we don't look
Let's let it go, better if we fall in love with our eyes closed

Do you think I have forgotten

You and I (Don't let go)
We're alive (Don't let go)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (Don't let go)
And pretend (Don't let go, oh)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (In the end)

And there was something about you that now I can't remember
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender

I never know what to think about
I think about you (Don't let go)
About you (Don't let go)

",,"The ideal background for The 1975's ""About You"" is a retro-cinematic, melancholic, and deeply atmospheric montage that visually embodies a lost memory or a lingering longing. Focus on cool-toned, muted visuals dominated by hazy blues, purples, and greys, often highlighted by the warm, blurred glow of city lights at night, rainy window reflections, or foggy car scenes. The cinematography should be slow, dreamy, and highly reflective, using soft focus or film grain to create a feeling of looking back in time, perfectly mirroring the song's themes of remembered intimacy and the melancholic question, ""Do you think I have forgotten... About you?""",https://youtu.be/tGv7CUutzqU?si=hvYh6PYGvFg41yMP,,5:26,English ,,5,Youtube likes ,Required 
Panchayat Theme song ,Anurag Saikia,"light-hearted, nostalgic, humorous",,nan,,"The ""Panchayat"" theme song is predominantly used in light-hearted, slice-of-life comedy Reels that find humor in the mundane realities of everyday life, particularly within the context of small-town or administrative settings. Creators leverage the music to set a gently comedic tone for relatable struggles and low-stakes drama, such as dealing with simple domestic tasks, minor office politics, or frustrating encounters with faulty equipment. By accompanying visuals of quiet observation, moments of boredom, or simple actions like having a cup of tea, the theme song transforms the ordinary into something significant and subtly humorous.",https://youtu.be/oYrMqcWBscI?si=pv1A18EF_-WOIOgk,#Funny Reels,1:0,,Orchestral / Indian Folk Fusion,3,Youtube likes ,Required
